        <h2>Our Commitment</h2>
        <p>
          Yaqin exists to serve humanity by making Islamic knowledge
          accessible to all. We collect only the minimal data necessary to
          provide and improve our service. We do not sell your data, show
          advertisements, or track you across the web.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

        <h3>1.1 Account Information (Optional)</h3>
        <p>

        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Note:</strong> An account is not required to search the Quran
          or Hadith. You can use our search features anonymously without
          creating an account.
        </p>

        <h3>1.2 Chat History (Authenticated Users Only)</h3>

          <li>Timestamps of conversations</li>
          <li>Chat visibility settings (public/private)</li>

          <strong>Control:</strong> You can delete individual chats or your
          entire chat history at any time from your account settings.
        </p>

        <h3>1.3 Search Queries (Anonymous)</h3>
        <p>
          When you search the Quran or Hadith without an account:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Search queries are processed in real-time</li>
          <li>
            We do NOT store your search queries or link them to your identity
          </li>
          <li>
            We may collect anonymized aggregate statistics (e.g., "How many
            people searched for 'patience' this month?")
          </li>
        </ul>
